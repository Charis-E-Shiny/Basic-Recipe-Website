            It’s hard to resist a crispy and flaky Samosa filled with delicious spiced potatoes. This perfected chef’s recipe will help you make the BEST potato Samosas at home. If you ever wondered how those eateries selling authentic Punjabi foods make the crispiest and flakiest samosas, you got to try this recipe.
            My step by step photo guide and video will help you make them perfectly, the Indian street style way! Super flaky and crunchy crust without all that extra grease! The BEST samosas are actually made on the streets of India and in budget eateries, not in the upscale restaurants.
            Samosa is a fried pastry snack, usually with a filling of spiced potatoes. They are very popular in India, Middle East & Asian countries. They originated from the Middle East and were brought to India by the Merchants. Today Samosa is one of the most eaten snack in the South Asian Countries.
            You will find variations with mixed vegetables, keema, only onions and cheese/paneer. But nothing beats the Classic potato version and these are the most popular street snack in India.

            <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <p><strong>Boil Potatoes</strong></p>
            <ol>
                <li>Peel, halve and boil potatoes in a pot of water, until fork tender (not mushy).</li>
                <li>Crumble the potatoes, don't mash them. Keep aside.</li>
            </ol>

            <p><strong>Make Dough (or use frozen puff pastry sheets)</strong></p>
            <ol>
                <li>Mix together flour, carom seeds, salt and oil in a mixing bowl.</li>
                <li>Rub the flour well with your fingers or in between your palms for 3 to 4 mins to incorporate the oil. It should look like breadcrumbs and this is very important to make flaky samosa.</li>
                <li>Take handful of flour and press down with your fingers. It must hold shape and not crumble. This is an indication that the oil is well incorporated.</li>
                <li>Add water little by little and mix the flour to form a slightly stiff yet pliable dough. It should not be very soft like roti/naan dough. Cover and rest for 25 to 30 mins.</li>
            </ol>

            <p><strong>Make Potato Filling</strong></p>
            <ol>
                <li>Heat a pan with oil. Add cumin seeds.</li>
                <li>When they begin to sizzle, add ginger & green chilies. Fry until ginger smells aromatic, for about 30 to 60 seconds.</li>
                <li>Stir in the green peas and saute for 2 mins.</li>
                <li>Add red chili powder, garam masala, cumin powder & fennel powder. Saute for 30 seconds.</li>
                <li>Stir in the potatoes and sprinkle salt. Mix and saute for 2 to 3 mins. Mix in coriander leaves & set aside to cool.</li>
                <li>Taste and add more salt if needed. If using lemon juice, add it now. Divide the mixture roughly to 10 portions.</li>
            </ol>

            <p><strong>How to Make Samosa</strong></p>
            <ol>
                <li>Knead the dough gently to smoothen a bit. Divide it to 5 portions and roll to balls. Cover the dough balls until the end, to prevent drying out.</li>
                <li>Grease the rolling area and then flatten a ball. Drizzle a few drops of oil.</li>
                <li>Begin to roll to a circle or oval shaped disc. (Around 8.5 inches long by 6.5 inches wide). It should be neither too thick nor too thin.</li>
                <li>Using a knife cut it to two semicircles. The 2 parts make 2 samosas. If the edges are too thick, gently roll it to thin down.</li>
                <li>Work on one part – apply water over the straight edge (towards the cut side). Join the edges to make a cone. Press down gently to seal the cone from inside as well. (If you have trouble sticking them, make a paste of flour and water, smear that lightly & then stick)</li>
                <li>Fill the cone with one portion of potato masala and press down with your finger to push it inside the cone. Smear water generously on both the other edges.</li>
                <li>Bring the edges together and seal them by pinching off the edges together. If you prefer to make a standing samosa, make a pleat on one side. Bring back the pleat and seal it by pinching off the edges together.</li>
                <li>Make sure the samosa is sealed well. Cover them with a cloth to prevent drying.</li>
            </ol>

            <p><strong>Deep Fry</strong></p>
            <ol>
                <li>After you make 5 samosas, begin to heat the oil until medium hot.</li>
                <li>Oil has to be medium hot and not very hot or cold. A piece of dough dropped in the oil should not sizzle or rise immediately. Instead you should see tiny bubbles in the oil & the dough should take a while to come up to the surface. This is the right temperature.</li>
                <li>Gently add as many samosas as you can to the oil and fry them on a low flame, undisturbed for few minutes (about 10 to 12 mins).</li>
                <li>When the crust becomes firm, increase the flame to medium. Turn them to the other side and fry until crispy and golden.</li>
                <li>While the first batch of samosas fry, make the rest of them. Remove the golden fried samosas to a wired rack or a steel colander. Let the temperature of oil come down slightly before you fry the next batch.</li>
            </ol>

            <p><strong>Bake Samosa in Oven</strong></p>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat the oven at 180 C or 360 F for about 20 mins. Brush each samosa generously with oil all over and place them on a prepared tray. Bake these for about 35 to 40 mins.</li>
            </ol>

            <p><strong>In the Air Fryer</strong></p>
            <ol>
                <li>Spray your samosa with oil or brush with ghee. Preheat your air fryer for 7 mins at 360 F or 180 C if required.</li>
